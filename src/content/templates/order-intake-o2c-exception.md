Orders arriving by email, PDF and portal validated and exceptions routed instead of rekeyed: extract and normalise order lines, validate against customer, pricing, product and credit master data, queue exceptions with reason codes and a recommended correction, and draft the customer response.

> **Retail & CPG template.** This is a Microsoft 365 Copilot **Cowork** plugin package — a `.zip` bundling the skills, rules, and contracts below.

## Skills in this package

- **exception-route** — Queues validation exceptions with reason codes and a recommended correction per exception, deterministically. Use on "route the exceptions", "what needs fixing before entry", after order-validate.
- **line-normalize** — Normalises extracted order lines - whitespace, casing, UOM tokens, qty formats - without changing meaning, preparing them for validation. Use after order-ingest.
- **order-ingest** — Ingests orders arriving as email, PDF or portal export into the rtl.order-intake-o2c.v1 contract. Use when the user says "order came in by email", "key in this PO", "process the attached order", or an order document arrives.
- **order-validate** — Validates the order against customer, pricing, product and credit masters deterministically with the order_validate engine. Use on "is this order clean", "validate before entry", after line-normalize.
- **response-draft** — Drafts the customer confirmation or clarification message and the internal entry note from the routed payload. Use to close every order run - "draft the reply to the customer", "write up the order status".

## Demo data

The package ships synthetic demo scenarios so you can run the template end-to-end before wiring it to your own systems. Each scenario has a happy path and a messier one, with the expected outputs alongside the inputs.

## Install

1. Download the plugin package (the `.zip` on this page).
2. Upload it to your tenant via **M365 admin center › Manage apps › Upload custom app**, or sideload it for testing with the [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/microsoft-365-agents-toolkit-cli) (`atk install --file-path <zip> --scope Personal`).
3. Open **Cowork › Sources & Skills › Plugins** and enable it from the **Discover** section.

See [Build plugins for Copilot Cowork](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot/cowork/cowork-plugin-development) for details.

## Test evidence

A test report and sample prompt set are kept with the source, in [`submissions/order-intake-o2c-exception/tests/`](https://github.com/SravaniSeethi/industry-templates/tree/main/submissions/order-intake-o2c-exception/tests).

## Before you use it on real work

This template is draft-first and document-grounded: it prepares the work for a person to review and sign off, and it does not write back to a system of record. The rules, thresholds, and reference documents in `references/` are examples — replace them with your own before production use.
