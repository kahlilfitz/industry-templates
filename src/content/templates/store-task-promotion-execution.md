Turn the HQ campaign pack into a store-specific, verifiable execution plan before launch day: map requirements to the store's format and cluster, flag pricing and signage conflicts deterministically, rank exceptions by revenue impact, and draft the readiness checklist and shift brief.

> **Retail & CPG template.** This is a Microsoft 365 Copilot **Cowork** plugin package — a `.zip` bundling the skills, rules, and contracts below.

## Skills in this package

- **brief-draft** — Drafts the store readiness checklist, the shift brief in store language, and the exception escalation from the contract payload. Use to close every execution run - "draft the shift brief", "write up the readiness pack".
- **exception-raise** — Ranks readiness exceptions by revenue at stake with the exception_rank engine and raises the exception list. Use when the user asks "what do we fix first", "rank the gaps", or after readiness-check.
- **pack-ingest** — Ingests the HQ campaign pack, price file, planogram and task list into the rtl.store-task-promotion-execution.v1 contract. Use when the user says "new campaign pack landed", "prep the store for the launch", "are we ready for Monday's promo", or when a store assignment arrives.
- **readiness-check** — Tests store readiness against the campaign pack deterministically - applicability, completeness, fixture conflicts and price integrity - with the readiness_check engine. Use when the user asks "are we ready", "any gaps for launch", "check the pack against my store".
- **store-map** — Retrieves the store profile - format, cluster, fixtures, received assets, completed tasks, prior execution history - for the readiness test. Use after pack-ingest, or when the user asks "what does this store actually have".

## Demo data

The package ships synthetic demo scenarios so you can run the template end-to-end before wiring it to your own systems. Each scenario has a happy path and a messier one, with the expected outputs alongside the inputs.

## Install

1. Download the plugin package (the `.zip` on this page).
2. Upload it to your tenant via **M365 admin center › Manage apps › Upload custom app**, or sideload it for testing with the [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/microsoft-365-agents-toolkit-cli) (`atk install --file-path <zip> --scope Personal`).
3. Open **Cowork › Sources & Skills › Plugins** and enable it from the **Discover** section.

See [Build plugins for Copilot Cowork](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot/cowork/cowork-plugin-development) for details.

## Test evidence

A test report and sample prompt set are kept with the source, in [`submissions/store-task-promotion-execution/tests/`](https://github.com/SravaniSeethi/industry-templates/tree/main/submissions/store-task-promotion-execution/tests).

## Before you use it on real work

This template is draft-first and document-grounded: it prepares the work for a person to review and sign off, and it does not write back to a system of record. The rules, thresholds, and reference documents in `references/` are examples — replace them with your own before production use.
