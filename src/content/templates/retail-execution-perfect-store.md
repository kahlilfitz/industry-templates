Photos attach as evidence, never scored by vision. It does not place the order, change the planogram or issue trade credit."

A prepared call and a complete, evidenced visit report: assemble the pre-call plan, score the perfect-store gap deterministically against the channel standard, rank gaps by revenue impact rather than count, and draft the visit report, action register and suggested order for the rep to confirm.

> **Retail & CPG template.** This is a Microsoft 365 Copilot **Cowork** plugin package — a `.zip` bundling the skills, rules, and contracts below.

## Skills in this package

- **action-register** — Ranks gaps by revenue at stake with the gap_rank engine and builds the action register and suggested order for the rep to confirm. Use on "what do I fix first", "rank the gaps", "build my order", after gap-score.
- **gap-score** — Scores perfect-store compliance deterministically from the visit audit answers with the visit_score engine - photos attach as evidence, never scored by vision. Use after the visit: "score the visit", "how compliant is the store".
- **standard-retrieve** — Retrieves the perfect-store / picture-of-success standard, planogram and promo calendar for the outlet's channel and cluster. Use on "what's the standard for this outlet", "what should this store look like", after visit-prep.
- **visit-prep** — Assembles the pre-call plan for a specific outlet - profile, last visit's open actions, promotion status, recent scan performance - into the rtl.retail-execution-perfect-store.v1 contract. Use when the rep says "prep me for <outlet>", "what's the plan for today's calls", "pre-call for store <id>".
- **visit-report** — Drafts the evidenced visit report and action register from the contract payload. Use to close every visit: "write the visit report", "log the visit".

## Demo data

The package ships synthetic demo scenarios so you can run the template end-to-end before wiring it to your own systems. Each scenario has a happy path and a messier one, with the expected outputs alongside the inputs.

## Install

1. Download the plugin package (the `.zip` on this page).
2. Upload it to your tenant via **M365 admin center › Manage apps › Upload custom app**, or sideload it for testing with the [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/microsoft-365-agents-toolkit-cli) (`atk install --file-path <zip> --scope Personal`).
3. Open **Cowork › Sources & Skills › Plugins** and enable it from the **Discover** section.

See [Build plugins for Copilot Cowork](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot/cowork/cowork-plugin-development) for details.

## Test evidence

A test report and sample prompt set are kept with the source, in [`submissions/retail-execution-perfect-store/tests/`](https://github.com/SravaniSeethi/industry-templates/tree/main/submissions/retail-execution-perfect-store/tests).

## Before you use it on real work

This template is draft-first and document-grounded: it prepares the work for a person to review and sign off, and it does not write back to a system of record. The rules, thresholds, and reference documents in `references/` are examples — replace them with your own before production use.
